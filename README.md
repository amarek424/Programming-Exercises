# Programming-Exercises
article.txt:
The input file used when running Test.java and Test.pl

Test.java:
Taking article.txt as an input file, this Java program counts the number of words in a line and appends it to the end. It outputs to a text file called output.txt. (Shown in this repository as output1.txt)

Test.pl:
Also taking article.txt as an input file, this Perl script counts the number of occurences per word in the file. It then outputs each word and its corresponding number of occurences in descending order into a text file called output.txt. (Shown in this repository as output2.txt). NOTE: words connected to double or single quotes are treated as unique instances of a word due to the ANSI text file format when reading. Should be updated to decode/encode to result in more accurate results.
